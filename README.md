SheShield is a next-generation women’s safety web platform that combines real-time reporting, analytics, safe navigation, and education — **powered by genuine Pune police crime data (Jan–Oct 2024)**.

## 💡 Why I Built This

Every day, women in India and around the world face harassment and threats — on campuses, streets, and even at work or online. Most solutions only respond after something bad has happened.  
**SheShield is different:**  
It’s built to *prevent* danger, give real-time situational awareness, and empower users to proactively avoid unsafe areas. My vision was to create technology that not only reacts, but protects, educates, and helps women take control — using real police data, not just assumptions.
